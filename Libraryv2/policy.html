<ul>
<li>Provide false or misleading information when creating your user account</li>
<li>Share your password with another person or allow another person to use your user account</li>
<li>Access another user's account without their permission or attempt to manipulate the system in any unauthorized way</li>

<li>Damage or deface books, or fail to report lost or damaged books to the library</li>
</ul>
<p>If the library suspends or terminates your user account, you will be notified by email or other means, and your access to the Library Management System will be restricted accordingly. The library's decision to suspend or terminate your user account will be final, and no appeals or exceptions
